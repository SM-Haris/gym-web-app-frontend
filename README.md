## Deployment
GymUp is designed for deployment on a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel. These platforms offer seamless deployment from your Git repository, allowing you to make your gym management application readily accessible.

Here's a general deployment guideline:

* **Choose a Hosting Platform**: Select a reliable hosting provider like Netlify or Vercel. Sign up for an account and familiarize yourself with their deployment process.

* **Prepare Your Application**: Ensure your application is production-ready. This may involve building the project for production and potentially running any necessary pre-deployment steps as specified in your project's configuration.

* **Connect Your Git Repository**: Link your project's Git repository (e.g., GitHub) to your chosen hosting platform. This allows the platform to automatically deploy your application when you push code changes to your repository.

* **Deploy Your Application**: Follow the specific instructions provided by your hosting platform to initiate deployment. This typically involves setting up build commands and deployment configurations.

* **Access Your Deployed Application**: Once deployment is successful, you'll receive a URL from your hosting platform where your application is publicly accessible. Share this URL with your gym members or staff to grant them access to the gym management system.

**Remember**: Specific deployment instructions may vary depending on your chosen hosting provider. Refer to their documentation for detailed guidance.
